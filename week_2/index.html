		<h3 class="center"> Learning Fusion 360</h3>
		<p>Fusion 360 is a much more complex 3D modeling platform that I was use to. Being use to the simplicity of AutoCAD, Fusion's sketch features and many different features was definitely a little overwhelming. Looking through videos, the things that could be modeled amazed me. I looked at recommended videos on from the course website. From simple sketches to being able to build cars, stimulate tension (which took be abck to my 8th grade bridge builder days), make production drawings, build complex circuit boards, and mill materials, it definitely seemed like Fusion 360 could do it all. Although, knowing that alot of the things were very complex for the assignment, it was definitely interesting and maybe when I have some free time I'll look other options</p>
		<p>A little more related to the projects for this week, browsing the internet I found someone who build the Oblivion Move Blaster. Although, I am not familiar with the movie Oblivion, I liked the freeform type of modeling he did since he didn't have percise measurements. Although I looked at other videos as well, most of the learning I got through trial and error during builds.</p>

		<h3 class="center"> Press Fit Assembly: </h3>
		<p> This week, for the press fit assembly, me and <a href='https://samjo4788.github.io/PHYSCI-70/'>Samantha Jones</a> teamed up. Due to her closer location to Harvard she was able to pick the peices up, but before that, we had to figure out what to build. After a day of thinking of possible builds, she proposed the idea a tie fighter from Star Wars. As I had no real reasons to say no, we went with it and started splitting up the parts. She took the wings, and I took the cockpit. We each did our own peices that connected the cockpit and wings. For measurements, Samantha found a picture (shown) that we used to get rough estimates of the ships's proportions from. After deciding on a diameter of 60mm for the cockpit, we went our own ways and started to build.</p>

			<h3 class="center"> The Idea Stage: </h3>
			<p> I spent a good amount of times trying to figure out how to build the cockpit. I was struggling since it isn't just a sphere, it is a truncated oval, and we are using 2D cuts. I decided that I could make 3 circles with notches to represent the general shape, and then I could make arched peices that fit into the circles perpendicular to their flat side, that provide the general curvature of the cockpit (see pictures). Another situation I ran into was that I had to be extremely carfeul the whole time since I was building on such a small scale I couldn't build a support that looked big but was only a mere few millimeters wide.</p>
			<h3 class="center"> The Circle Building Stage: </h3> 
			<p> I started with the circle. I set parameters for diameter, notch depth, height, and kerf. Although, not positive I was using the parameters 100% correctly, I did use them a lot and even went back and changed them for some easy edits. After abusing the power of the circluar array tool (my favorite), I got a general outline for a cirle in a sketch environment with notches. Although, I realised that ten notches may have been too many due to the how close everything was. Since I didn't know how to simply change the number of notches (which I think I could do now by going back in the timeline and changing my edits in the circular array tool), that ended my design "circle" and I started another file called "acutal_circle." I was confident I had it this time. Little did I know, after building a circle with eight notches, I realized that that still seemed like to many and so that ended by file "actual_circle." Finally, I created my true part, very creatively called, "actual_actual_circle" (it was getting late cut me some slack).</p>
