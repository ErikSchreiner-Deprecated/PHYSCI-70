		<h3 class="center"> Learning Fusion 360</h3>
		<p>Fusion 360 is a much more complex 3D modeling platform than I was used to. Being used to the simplicity of AutoCAD, Fusion's sketch features and many different features were a little overwhelming. Looking through videos, the things that could be modeled amazed me. I looked at recommended videos from the course website. From simple sketches to bing able to build cars, stimulate tension (which took me back to my 8th-grade bridge builder days), make production drawings, build complex circuit boards, and mill materials, it seemed like Fusion 360 could do it all. Although the assignment wasn't as complex, it was interesting and maybe when I have some free time I'll look at other features.</p>
		<p>A little more related to the projects for this week, browsing the internet I found someone who built the Oblivion Move Blaster. Although I am not familiar with the movie Oblivion, I liked the freeform type of modeling he did since he didn't have precise measurements. Although I looked at other videos as well, most of the learning I got through trial and error during builds.</p>	</div>

		<h3 class="center"> Press Fit Assembly: </h3>
		<p> This week, for the press-fit assembly, me and <a href='https://samjo4788.github.io/PHYSCI-70/'>Samantha Jones</a> teamed up. Due to her closer location to Harvard, she was able to pick the pieces up, but before that, we had to figure out what to build. After a day of thinking of possible builds, she proposed the idea of a tie fighter from Star Wars. As I had no real reasons to say no, we went with it and started splitting up the parts. She took the wings, and I took the cockpit. We each made our own pieces that connected the cockpit and wings. For measurements, Samantha found a picture (shown) that we used to get rough estimates of the ships' proportions. After deciding on a diameter of 60mm for the cockpit, we went our separate ways and started to build.</p>

			<h4 class="center"> The Idea Stage: </h4>
			<p> I spent a good amount of time trying to figure out how to build the cockpit. I was struggling since it isn't just a sphere, it is a truncated oval, and we are using 2D cuts. I decided that I could make 3 circles with notches to represent the general shape, and then I could make arched pieces that fit into the circles perpendicular to their flat side, that provide the general curvature of the cockpit (see pictures). Another situation I ran into was that I had to be extremely careful the whole time since I was building on such a small scale. I had to be careful to not build a support that looked big but was only a mere few millimeters wide.</p>
			<h4 class="center"> The Circle Building Stage: </h4> 
			<p> I started with the circle. I set parameters for diameter, notch depth, height, and kerf. Although not positive I was using the parameters 100% correctly, I did use them a lot and even went back and changed them for some easy edits. After abusing the power of the circular array tool (my favorite), I got a general outline for a circle in a sketch environment with notches. Although, I realized that ten notches may have been too many due to how close everything was. Since I didn't know how to simply change the number of notches (which I think I could do now by going back in the timeline and changing my edits in the circular array tool), that ended my design "circle" and I started another file called "acutal_circle." I was confident I had it this time. Little did I know, after building a circle with eight notches, I realized that that still seemed like too many and so that ended by file "actual_circle." Finally, I created my true part, very creatively called, "actual_actual_circle" (it was getting late cut me some slack).</p>

		<h4 class="center"> The Connecting Pieces Building Stage: </h4>
		<p>To make it easier on myself I decided to build to connecting pieces before my arched pieces that way I can start to assemble my parts and see what I needed to build. Since we decided to build our own pieces that connected the cockpit and wings and just slide them together, my next step was figuring out how to connect the circle and the connectors. Samantha had a very great idea with connecting her pieces to the wings and I was considering something along the same lines, but I realized that if I did that my cockpit wouldn't have nearly enough support as I thought it should. So after spending some time building a connecting piece that wasn't usable, I had what I would say was my best design idea of the press-fit project. I thought what if I put a rectangular hole through the circle and then build 2 connecting pieces that fit together like a puzzle. Although not anything crazy I think that this was a great idea because in my mind it: 1) provided support to the circles (since it was continuous when connected) and 2) the circles provided support to it (since one of the circles overlapped the puzzle-like joint and finally, 3) It was something unique. 
		So, I sketched it out with agreed-upon length and after struggling with some extruding and sketch difficulties, I was able to make my puzzle-like connectors. </p>	</div>

		<h4 class="center"> The Arched Pieces: </h4>
		<p> When building the arched pieces, I first started to assemlbe my pieces to get a visual of what I needed. I'm glad I did this or else they probably wouldn't have probably went together with my original idea. Once I assmebled my circle pieces and the connectors, I was able to use their outlines and what space they took up to quickly sketch out the arched pieces. To get the arch, I used to arc feature and used a circle corresponding to the original diameter as a guide line for the arc. After that it was a simple extrude to the parameter of "h" (for height) and all my pieces were done.</p>

		<h4 class="center"> The Fusion Assembly: </h4>
		<p> Now that I had all my pieces, and since Samantha shared her pieces with me, I decided to assemble them in Fusion. After joining Samantha's shared project, saving all her pieces, I was able to start to import my pieces and her pieces and build the tie fighter. The pictures show step by step what I did, first starting with the connecting pieces, then adding in my circles. After placing my circles in their respective locations, I imported all my arched pieces and rotated them the proper amount. After those were put in place I imported Samantha's wing assembly and attached it to my cockpit assembly.  </p>

		<h4 class="center"> The Real Life Assembly: </h4>
		<p> At this point we shared out .dxf files with Nathan (or at least Samantha did, I forgot about the .dxf step, sorry!). He printed them up and after Samantha picked them up we zoom and she assembled the pieces. I will say that her pieces seem to go together really well. My pieces I cannot say the same for. My pieces were very loose and I credit that to the digital aspect of this project and additionally possibly some mistakes with kerf. Although loose, a bit of tape secured their position and we had our tie fighter. In the end, I know that Fusion 360 is a cool tool that has many hidden mysteries to me. Knowing a few more of those mysteries definitely would have made my build a bit easier, nevertheless, it was a pleasure working with Samantha and overall it was a good introduction to Fusion 360. </p>

		<h3 class="center"> Modeling Kit Pieces:</h3>
		<p>For my two parts modeling I picked a resistor and the stepper motor. With lots of other work to do, I wanted to make one good, and then the other try something new but fast. So the one I tried to make as detailed as possible was the motor, and the resistor was the one that I cut some corners on but found some other features of Fusion 360 by doing.</p>

		<h4 class="center"> The Motor Build:</h4>
		<p> With the motor I tried to be as detailed as possible. It was hard getting some of the smaller, less than a millimeter measurements, but with some math to find dimensions, I am very happy with my final product. First, I measured everything using the caliper. After that, I got the general box-like shape into Fusion 360. I then used my measurements to get the proper circular indents and extrusions on the top of the motor. After getting the metal bar in the center, I started to make some finer detail measurements. These included the little flat section on the protruding bar, the screw holes (complete with threads), the corner extensions, and finally the bump sides that the motor has. I would say it was the most satisfying using the hole tool to instantly create a hole where I wanted while adding threads in the same step. This made it very easy to make the top screw holes while adding detail. In the end, I used the appearance tool to make it look more like my motor. There are two other details I think are worth mentioning.</p>

		<h4 class="center"> The Motor Build: Side Bumps </h4>
		<p> This first detail is the bumpy sides the motor has. Since I found it impossible to get any real measurements from this due to the small size, I decided to do a little estimating. I estimated that there were around 32 small bumps in the area they take up (approximately 16mm). With this knowledge, I was able to create a line in a sketch, use the rectangular array tool to make 64 lines across the 16mm face, and extrude every other rectangle to an extremely small depth to cut the face of the motor. Before using the cut feature, I made them into bodies and rotated them to account for all the sides (this gave me a large number of bodies in the sidebar which I couldn't help but find a little amusing). At this point, I then use the combine tool to cut the motor with all of the small indents to create little bumps. I was very happy with how it turned out. </p>

		<h4 class="center"> The Motor Build: Screw Holes and Screws </h4>
		<p> The other detail that I wanted to talk about was the screws. I had 2 different experiences with screws in this build. The first was creating the holes on top of the motor. Using the hole tool I was able to visualize the hole before it was made and add threads at the same time with is a really neat feature.</p>
		<p> The other experience with screws I had was importing the screws for the bottom through McMaster-Carr. I liked that it was super simple to just click "insert --> insert component through McMaster-Carr" and then through their website narrow down what screw I wanted by clicking their filters. There are so many parts there easily accessible and it was a good way to get a real-life component into my design.</p>	</div>

		<h3 class="center"> The Resistor Build: </h3>
		<p> In my search through 3D modeling videos for fusion I found someone that inserted an image of a picture, scaled it properly, and then freely build using the picture as a scale. I wanted to try something similar although this would never be desirable for precise measurements. I first took a picture of a resistor, imported it into Fusion using the "insert --> canvas" feature, and then right-clicked it from the browser to calibrate its length. From there I used the line tool to create reference points for me to create circles. After finishing my reference points I changed my sketch face by creating new sketches and created circles at each reference point that looked to be as wide as the picture. I then extruded, filleted, and combined them to make it reflect the looks of a resistor. Funnily enough, although not everything used precision measurements with the caliper, it was very accurate to the true measurements.</p>
