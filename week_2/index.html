		<h3 class="center"> Learning Fusion 360</h3>
		<p>Fusion 360 is a much more complex 3D modeling platform that I was use to. Being use to the simplicity of AutoCAD, Fusion's sketch features and many different features was definitely a little overwhelming. Looking through videos, the things that could be modeled amazed me. I looked at recommended videos on from the course website. From simple sketches to being able to build cars, stimulate tension (which took be abck to my 8th grade bridge builder days), make production drawings, build complex circuit boards, and mill materials, it definitely seemed like Fusion 360 could do it all. Although, knowing that alot of the things were very complex for the assignment, it was definitely interesting and maybe when I have some free time I'll look other options</p>
		<p>A little more related to the projects for this week, browsing the internet I found someone who build the Oblivion Move Blaster. Although, I am not familiar with the movie Oblivion, I liked the freeform type of modeling he did since he didn't have percise measurements. Although I looked at other videos as well, most of the learning I got through trial and error during builds.</p>

		<h3 class="center"> Press Fit Assembly </h3>
		<p> This week, for the press fit assembly, me and <a href='https://samjo4788.github.io/PHYSCI-70/'>Samantha Jones</a> teamed up. Due to her closer location to Harvard she was able to pick the peices up. After a day of thinking of possible builds, she proposed the idea a tie fighter from Star Wars. As I had no real reasons to say no, we went with it and started splitting up the parts. She took the wings, and I took the cockpit. We each did our own peices that connected the cockpit and wings. For measurements, Samantha found a picture (shown) that we used to </p>
