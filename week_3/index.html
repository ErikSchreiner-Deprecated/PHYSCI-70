		<h3 class="center"> Brainstorming: </h3>
		<p>For this project I wasn't to modivated at first. I didn't really have any good ideas, but after some thinging I came up with 3 decent ideas. The first was to make a boat at sea and have it rocking back and forth and maybe have the waves moving as well. The second was to make a pinball machine that would return the ball to the top automatically. The thrid was a plinko-hybrid sculpture. Essentially, I was thinking I could build something like the plinko machine at the Museum of Science but then use some sort of circuitry to continuously feed the balls in or change the direction of the stubs. I liked the idea of a pinball machine so I went with that one</p>

		</br>

		<h3 class="center"> The Pinball Machine: The Concept </h3>
		<p>I was thinking that for the pinball machine there would be two main parts. The first the platform where the bumper hit the "pinball" (a marble in my case). The second major part would be how the marble would get back to the top can continuously feed itself onto the platform. The inbetween parts could simpily be connectors that the marble could run through.</p>

		<h4 class="center"> The Pinball Machine: The Platform </h4>
		<p>To begin,I gathered all the cardboard in my house. Luckily we collect carboard because we heat with a wood furnance, so I had a good amount to use. I also collected some coat hangers for the metal and a hot glue gun for peicing things together. The last thing I found that I thought would be useful was 2 summer games; one was ladder ball, and the other was similar to ladder ball. I took them out of their boxes and put them together to elevate the platform so you could stand at it.  </p>
		<p>At this point I started to build the actual platform of cardboard. To do this, I took a drill gun and screwed 2 holes into the plastic pipes that were part of the game kit. This allowed me to slide a piece of a metal coat hanger through a piece of cardboard and the holes to hold up one end. The other end just rested on the foundation I build for it, elevated above the other end. I then went about trying to build athe bumper.</p>
		<p>I wasn't entirely sure if I could make it super responsive like a actual pinball machine, so instead I settled by creating a first class lever that would be the bumper. One side of the folcrum would hit the marble, while the other would have a force applied to it by the motor. The length of the side getting hit by the motor was significantly smaller to increase the speed at which the other end would spin. Then, to apply the force, I created a circle with a "triangle" attached tangently to the edge which would be responsible for making contact with the lever. My first iteration I created way too triangles, initially, so I ended up going with only one, which gave a decent speed, while keeping the part small enough. At this point I had everyhting I needed to set up the platform with walls and a bumper. To limit the motion of the bumper I used pieces of coast hangers to act as a barrier to it's motion. This also worked pretty well since it allowed the bumper to bounce back to its original position. Then I put a net underneath it which was slanted. This caught the marble when missed and funneled it to where I was expecting it to be lifted back up to the top.</p>

			<h4 class="center"> The Pinball Machine: The Marble Returner </h4>
			<p> I wasn't entirely sure how to effectively lift marble about 3-4 feet up. My initial thought was to essentially create a vertical conveyer belt, but then I struggled to connect something to that which would lift the marble. After some other ideas, I had the idea to create an Archimedes screw which I would spin around and due to the angle of the screw and the roational force hypothetically would lift the marble. I wasn't sure if it was even a valid idea so I created a small prototype which actually worked in getting the marble up an inch or two. So, I stated found a bigger tube that I could create a screw-like shape on. I started to cut out the carboard into squares with circles cut out in the center (which I did by used the scissor like a jigsaw. I then put a slit in them which allowed me to bend the cardboard which gave it it's slant feature. After glueing some of these onto the tube, I was not entirely sure if it was going to work since it was getting much heavier than expected. So I set up it how I expected it to go when finished (which consisted of it being on a smalled tube to support it), and it didn't even spin. I tried adjusting the toy gears I was using to create more torque, but with only a fourth of it done, I realized it wasn't going to work when fully built.  </p> 
			<p> Sadly, I realized as I was putting a good amount of time into this, that I didn't have a back up plan and so I was kinda banking on the Archimedes screw to work. Sadly, since it didn't work, I wasn't able to automate the marble going back to the top, this definitely make the whole project not nearly as impressive as I was hoping. I am pretty confident with more time and better materials (like thinner cardboard, or 3d printing) the Archimedes screw would work.

			<h4 class="center"> The Pinball Machine: Final Touches </h4>
			<p> In the end I added a couple extra features onto the platform. I didn't have the time to find a way to continuously feed the ball in. I think if I did this again I would defintiely maybe spend a little less time thinking about making it perfect and just doing it. I would try and make the bumper have more force behind it, maybe through the use of gears. Overall, it looked like it was coming out good, until it all just fell apart without being able to return the ball. I could make many improvements and edits, but as for the platform goes, everything turned out pretty well.

			<h3 class="center"> The Circuitry/Other Assignments: </h3>
			<p> I used most of the space on the big breadboard to eliminate clutter. I had a button which when pressed would spin the motor and move the bumper. I added the potentiometer so I could control the speed if needed, but at max it was fine. Measuring the voltage across the motor I got 5 Votls, which made sense since I had it connected to the 5 Volt plug on the Metro. Although for Ohm's Law since I didn't know the resistance of the motor I was unable to calculate current. Which is something I plan to ask about in Lab.
			</p>
			<p> Additionally, the other assignment was to use the "Microcontroller Analog in (ADC) to measure the voltage of a potentiometer, or other voltage-divider-based sensor." I was able to pull up the sketch on the Ardiuno app and open the serial monitor. But all I was getting was a lot of noise. I wasn't exactly sure what I was suppose tot do from that point, so once again I plan to ask about it in Lab. I did see how to do it in Lab previously, but since my board was only half set up, I wasn't able to follow along. Since I waited a little to long I forgot how to exactly do it when I tried to.
