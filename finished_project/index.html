                <p>Below are two YouTube videos of my project. One is an extended cut which includes me just having fun with Premiere Pro. The second is the demo only. I struggled to film the harp since it didn't work properly and it is supposed to be used in the dark. The description of these videos on YouTube provides more background on what is going on if you are confused. Furthermore, let me say this was my first time ever using any proper editing software. I am very well aware that the extended version is very far from flawless but making this was a great way to become familiar with Premiere Pro in a day. Let just put behind the poor cuts and obvious video quality differences. I didn't have the time (nor the reason) to spend hours getting perfect videos on the extended cut since that was not the assignment. However, I thoroughly enjoyed making the extended cut and plan to do more with Premier Pro in the future because of it.</p>

            <p> It was my senior year of high school and I needed an elective. It was a small school and I didn't have many choices. I had already taken "Design and Drawing" and "CAD" and I wasn't interested in "Pottery." However, I had the option for an independent study, which I decided to take. I needed a project for this class and being on YouTube a good amount I had already stumbled across some musical instruments. One used tesla coils to create music (which although very cool I thought my school wouldn't like nor was I super interested in building something like that). But one of the other instruments was a "frameless laser harp." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2GDAkDjPCiFPtHYAVJijG-37IA-Bj58n">Linked</a> are the videos I remember watching and being very impressed by. Below is an excellent video describing how they work. I figured I'd give it a shot and try to build a basic one. Long story short, I completely failed and essentially only learned how to solder. Consequently, when I was looking for a more hands-on class I found PHYSCI-70 and already had a final project idea!

            <h3 class="center"> The Process:  </h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px"> Since a lot went into the project throughout the whole semester, I left out a good deal of the write-up. Although these parts were mainly getting oriented with my parts which aren't necessarily relevant. I will still include where I went wrong but realize there are a lot of areas for improvement. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="center" id="materials"> Materials: </h4>
            <p> The list of materials will differ slightly depending on your specific parts. However, in general you will need what follows or some subsitution of what follows. I broke up my parts into 4 different catergories:
            </p>

              </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px"> A full list of parts, where to get most of them, and their approximate price can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GbK67gsM7zYxF3S-5j8pz1rs1p3bBLgkOi0mYkAxDqQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. As noted within the sheet the total price is currently an upper bound since it assumes you don't have anything that comes in large kits and it assumes that you can only get these things in these kits and not individually. Additionally, I left out some very basic parts like simple wires, and I added some parts that I used when building my laser harp but don't necessarily need to be used (like the digital caliper).
            </p>

            <h4 class="center" id="building_the_circuit"> Building the circuit: </h4>
            <p> Below is a schematic of the circuit that needs to be built. In all cases but the stepper motor, the red wires are power, the black is ground, the yellow is analog and digital connections, and the purple are simple connectors. Note that although the signal pin of the analog light sensor is connected to pin 14, this pin is also an analog pin (A8) on the ESP 32 Feather (which is a different, but very similar, board than in the schematic). Just make sure that the sensor is connected to an analog-enabled pin. Additionally, the LED is representative of the laser which needs to be taken apart to be used in the circuit (this is why the alligator clips are needed). You can see from the pictures that the LED requires a MOSFET to be told when to turn on and off by the microcontroller. And finally, the capacitor is to prevent any unwanted voltage spikes.

              </figure>


            <h4 class="center" id="MIDI"> MIDI: </h4>

            <p>The whole goal behind the laser harp is to break a beam of light, have that light hit the sensor which in turn tells the microcontroller to send a MIDI note that corresponds to the beam being broken. Therefore, before continuing I needed a MIDI for the microcontroller. It is easy to hook one up using your computer (not I am on windows). You will need <a href="http://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/">this hairless MIDI to serial bridge</a>. This allows for serial outputs from the microcontroller to become MIDI signals. To play these signals you can use <a href="https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth"> VirtualMIDISynth</a>. However, there are things called SoundFonts. These can be thought of as... well fonts for sound. Essentially, depending on the input, you can change the instrument that is being played. That said, you must download and use a SoundFont with only one instrument, or else you cannot control the note and the instrument. This was one of those things that took me a little bit to figure out and when we hit the code, you will see why this is necessary. You can download a simple piano SoundFont from <a href="https://www.zanderjaz.com/downloads/soundfonts/pianos/"> here</a>. I'm using the "piano" SoundFont that is on the page. After putting this SoundFont into VirtualMIDISynth and changing your MIDI out to VirtualMIDISynth you are essentially all set to play MIDI data. The remaining steps will be discussed in the code section.

            <h4 class="center" id="the_code"> The Code: </h4>
            <p> In our code we will use two libraries. The first is Accelstepper, a library full of secrets with documentation located <a href="">here</a> which can be downloaded from the Arduino IDE. </p>

            <p> The second is the Arduino MIDI Library whose documentation can be found <a href="">here</a> and which can also be downloaded from the Arduino IDE. </p>

            <p> At this point, we have all the parts to start our code. I will break it up into 'before the "setup" function' and 'in the "setup" and "loop" functions.' First, let us take a look at what is before the setup function</p>

            <p> In this code we have the initialization of the MIDI communication, initialization of the stepper motor, the class which contains the "update" function telling a note to play or turn off, and the initialization of each beam as a note. A few comments: First, I imagine this code is not optimized. Second, you can find the note numbers <a href="https://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">here</a>. Also, I declared each beam to send notes through a different channel, this should work fine but might be unnecessary.</p>
            <p>Since the MIDI functionally "sendNoteOn/Off" is introduced in this block of code it is a good time to quickly look at what those functions do and how basic messages look like when they are received by the hairless serial to MIDI bridge. Below is a video of code running that plays an incrementing note every 1 second then shuts it off. It is mentioned in the next section the importance of the "Serial.begin(XXX);" line of code. Also, note that I do not show the VirtualMIDISynth in this video but I have it open with my wanted SoundFont chosen.

            <p> Here in the "setup" function everything should be pretty straightforward. The only thing to note is that for the hairless serial to MIDI bridge to work it needs to be on the same baud rate. You can change the baud rate by going to "File" --> "Preferences" within the hairless MIDI bridge. </p>
            <p> Within the loop function the first part is supposed to read the light level of the room. However, I found out last minute it seems as if the "delay(10);" line of code blocks the laser from being on which affects the reading. To fix this, removing this line of code should be sufficient. Within this part, it also sets the threshold for what the sensor must read to play a beam.</p>
            <p> The next part is what runs the stepper motor. First, huge shoutout to Nathan for the immense amount of help he gave me working with the very elusive AccelStepper library. By incrementing "n" we can increase the position of the stepper by a defined amount of steps. After a defined amount of increments, "dir" reverses sign reversing the direction teh stepper moves. I found that to work properly, the "setSpeed" line of code must be negative when turning backward, which is not exactly obvious since speed is a scalar. Also, the condition around "stepper.runSpeed();" is necessary, or else the stepper will turn continuously. I believed I narrowed why this is down to that without the condition, the stepper will hit "distanceToGo() == 0" then hit the line "stepper.runSpeed();" before the block of code that makes the stepper increment position, making the stepper move when it shouldn't yet. Additionally, within this section, it is important to note that "waitTime" must be declared larger than the time it takes to loop through the code (approx 30+ millis). I believe this has something to do with when the conditions "(stepper.distanceToGo() == 0)" and "(currentMillis - prevMillis >= waitTime)" are executed although I am not sure. Finally, the "Update" functions are called for each beam to see if the conditions to play a note are satisfied.  </p>

            <h4 class="center" id="comments"> More Comments/Improvements/Future Plans:</h4>
            <p>Before moving on to my 3D printing process, I quickly want to talk about potential improvements, directions to go, and comments about the code. The biggest thing is, when I was running my tests I noticed that it appears as if the "sendNoteOn" command is blocking and the laser is weaker than it should be. I'm grouping these because I think they are closely related. It appears that when the beam is broken and the light sensor picks up on it, the stepper starts to slow down, skip steps, and move a little more erratically while, at the same time, the laser gets brighter. I believe what is happening is that the stepper motor driver is calling less power since it's being blocked allowing for more current to go to the laser. One workaround to the laser's strength would be to hook it up to external batteries or using the 5V pin on the microcontroller (which the ESP32 Feather does not have). The workaround to it being blocking is to just make the whole code blocking. I was very focused on not making everything blocking, but I think that if the motor turns, check to see if a note should be played, then stop if yes or continue if no would address most of the problems I have encountered. This is something I am going to look into to see if I can get this to work. </p>

            <p>One other thing I could add which I incorporated space into my 3D print for is an end effector for the motor. I believe having a hull sensor with a magnet attached to the base of the mirror would allow to motor to be set into place without manually turning it (which is what I currently have to do). </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Also, there I noticed a library that is called "<a href="https://github.com/max22-/ESP32-BLE-MIDI">ESP32-BLE-MIDI</a>"" that I didn't see earlier. After a quick look, I think that this might be effective in getting rid of the need for the hairless serial to MIDI bridge and would allow the whole circuit to be more independent from the computer. I am not sure what will receive the MIDI signal on the computer, but it is still something I am interested in looking into.</p>

            <h4 class="center" id="the_3d_print"> The 3D Print:</h4> 
            <p>I am extremely happy with how the 3D print turned out. I planned to make something that will hold all the parts effectively, deal with unnecessary wires, while also being fairly compact. The idea was to create a long breadboard holder, on which I could mount the driver, microcontroller, and transistor circuitry for the LED. Then nearby have something that holds the motor and laser pointer. After some measurements and building in Fusion 360, I came up with something I was happy with. Below is my final product in Fusion in two forms. The first includes my vision for when parts were in the build (parts are represented by boxes. The second is the part does not include these "other parts."</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">The only thing that I'd change about the build is the size of the hole the laser is supposed to enter. It was slightly too small and therefore the laser couldn't go through all the way. Besides that, it is worth mentioning that the hole below the mirror is for the potential hull sensor as an end effector and mentioned within the "More Comments/Improvements/Future Plans:" section. Finally, to get the breadboard into the slot the little connector things on the side had to be cut off, but the fit was perfect after that.</p>

            <h3 id="closing_remarks"> Closing Remarks + More Photos/Videos: </h3>
            <p>Big shout out to Nathan, Victoria, and Sean for their significant help in overcome obstacles in both this project and others. This was by far one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken. I learned so much and now there is a lot I've learned that interests me that I don't want to stop doing. I plan to take you up on the offer of the FabLab being open to all. And then finally, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/sviZL8EMnniBXaCo6">linked</a> is a shared google album of some of the photos relevant to this project (some of which were included on this page others that were not). I figured it was a more user-friendly way to view photos/videos. Note that some of them are from initial tests and may include parts not be referenced within this documentation.</p>
