		<p> Born in Utah, raised in Upstate New York I spent most of my childhood outdoors. At the age 13 I finished the 46'ers, the 46 highest peak in the Adirondack Park in New York. I ran cross country, skiied cross country, biked, hiked, and I essentially did all that a child can do outside. Coming from a small town it was not hard to find space to be outside. With only 51 students in my graduating class my highschool can also be considered small. Although small, through the science wing at my highschool the class "Nanotechnology" was offered as a fun science class, the only one of it's sort. Loving math and physics, I took this oppurtunity up and after that class I hope to now eventually work in a similiar field. A current sophomore at the college I plan to concentrate in Physics and Math.</p>

		<p> When I am not doing school work I enjoy hanging out with my dogs (quite possible the cutest of dogs), skiing, running, bouldering (indoors), doing nothing, and traveling. I once heard someone say "Travel is the cure for ignorance." I believe that this statement has a lot of truth packed into it and I am lucky to say I have had oppurtunities to travel. I hope to keep traveling and experiencing new things help stay openminded. </p> 
		<p>I am hoping after this class I will be more modivated to tinker and have the creativity for projects. I can get lost in perfecting something and once I start something I am bound to finish it or come back to it.</p>
