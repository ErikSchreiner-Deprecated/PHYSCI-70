            <h3 class="center"> The Molding: </h3>
            <p> This week I found a few trinkets that I could of molded. I ended up deciding on on the spider duck becuase it was an interesting shape and I thought it would be cool if everything worked out. I used a pen as a hole to pour the liquid into and I tried to use some toothpicks and a popsicle stick as vents, although I will talk about what happened with those in a bit. I figured it was going to float so I had a phone holder that I planned to attach to the counter and hold the mold in place.

            <p> Now that I had the plan I mixed parts A and B, stirred, and poured ontop of my spider duck. I realized that the container I was using was a little to big to hold to mix and cover the duck so I had to switch mid-pouring to another container which was a 1 Cup measuring cup. After transfering the spider duck and the mix into the cup I took some time adjusting it so it wasn't to close to the sides and I used the phone holder to hold it in place. I don't have many pictures of the pouring part because my hands where a little busy and sticky.

            <h3 class="center"> The Cast: </h3>
            <p> My idea was to take the mold and just cut it in half to create a two part mold, which after some time did work. I first had to get the mold out of the measuring cup and because it was metal I couldn't flex it like plastic. I soon realized that the mold was nearly invincible and I was pushing a knife into the sides and then pusing up to get it out. I was making progress, but not enough where I would of gotten the mold out this century so I tried using 5 knifes grabbing them all at one and pulling, to my surpsise this actually worked. I realized that the spider duck was a little closer to the bottom than I thought so one side of the mold was very thin and delicate, but still thick enough to work.

            <p> Then I cut the mold in half along where I thought it would be convient for removing the spider duck--this went smoothly. Now that I had it out, I realized that the air vents I put in where not the greatest, expecially since they didn't cover all eight legs. I was worried about this pre-mold but I didn't really think to much about it. I spent a good amount of time trying to create air vents and the morals of the story is 1) create the vents before moldings 2) the mold is more indestuctible than I though because I was barely leaving a mark.

            <p> Now it was time to actually cast something. For simplicity, I just chose water. My air vents where not the greatest, but they worked okay. I wrapped some rubber bands around it and threw it in the freezer. One thing that I noticed was that the weak park on my mold did flex a litle when the water expanded. The beak also did break off when I removed the spider duck, but thats okay it can just be a weird looking spider. Honestly, since I am not a big fan of sticky things and I kinda just went all in on one mold (which I definitely thought I would mess up), I was not very exciting during the molding part, but after seeing how nice the mold came out it was definitely all worth it and a pretty cool week.
