      <h3 class="center"> Boat Propeller and Pros and Cons of Additive Technique:</h3>
      <p>Although I had a few ideas on items that were easier to fabricate using additive methods than subtractive methods, but I settled with a boat propeller. The reason why this is easier to fabricate using additive methods is because of the 3D curves and possible overlap of the blades. Expecially with the possible overlap of the blades it would be hard for a subtractive machining technique to get between the blades; this becomes more and more true as you add more blades (such as the the case of a fan). Additionally, due to the curved features of the blades although you could machine one side then turn it and machine the other, it is much easy and leaves less room for errors to build it additively. To print a propeller, I had to learn a little about them and understand thier dimensions. The next bit of this webpage me learning about propellers. <b> If you dont care about learning about propellers you can skip to my process of learning fusion propeller building by <a href="learning_prop"> clicking here</a> or to skip to the actual building <a href="fusion_prop" >click here</a></b></p>
      <h3 class="center"> Propellers:</h3>
      <p>To learn about propellers the best site I found was from <a href = "https://www.dmsonline.us/propellers-by-the-numbers/"> Datawave Marine Solutions</a>. According to this website there are nine main parts of propellers. Below they are listed with the most important thing I felt from each section;</p>

      <h4 class="center"> Propeller Diameter:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Measured from the cicrle the end of the blades create when spinning </li>
          <li> Bigger = better (as long as its underwater, doesn't hit anything, and usually is even with hull for protection) </li>
        </ul>
</br>
      <h4 class="center"> Number of Blades: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Ideally for less vibration/inteference with hull have an odd number of blades. </li>
        </ul>
</br>
      <h4 class="center"> Pitch: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Hypopthetical distance a propeller travels in a full spin.</li>
          <li> Pitch important due to strian it can put on motor. </li>
        </ul>
</br>
      <h4 class="center"> Blade Area: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Larger Blade Area = Stronger Thrust</li>
          <li> Need to be thick to not snap but thin enough to not create to much drag. </li>
          <li> Three main ways to talk about the area of a blade (due to their 3D) contortion </li>
            <ol>
              <li> Projected Area &rarr; The top down veiw of the blade (misses 3D shape) </li>
              <li> Developed Area &rarr; The top down untwisted blade </li> 
              <li> Expected Area &rarr; Shows thickness of the propeller </li> 
            </ol>
        </ul>
</br>
      <h4 class="center"> Blade Skew: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> When viewing top down, how bend back the blades are.</li>
          <li> Blade screw reduces vibrations </li>
        </ul>
</br>      
      <h4 class="center"> Blade Rake: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Generally, raked propellers reduce effeciency, but prevent air getting sucked down from above the water surface causing loss of thrust.</li>
          <li> Can have no, flat, or curve rake. </li>
        </ul>
</br>
      <h4 class="center"> Propeller Series Selection: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Generally, propellers aren't remade every time from a new template. They are adapted from different "standard series".  </li>
        </ul>
</br>
      <h4 class="center"> Rotation: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> If left rotates left and vis versa. </li>
          <li> Slower rotatoin speed generally = better effenciency </li>
        </ul>
</br>
      <h4 class="center"> Number of Propellers: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Two for redundancy, one for effeciency </li>
        </ul>
</br>
      <h4 class="center"> Other: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> From what I found in drawings, the blade length is 80% of the radius, whereas the center, circluar part radius is 20% of the total radius.</li>
        </ul>

            <h4 class="center"> <a id="learning_prop"> Learning to make Propeller in Fusion 360: </a> </h4>
            <p> I was pretty unsure on how to start to make a propeller in Fusion. The reason why it was hard to make subtractively was the same reason for why I was unsure where to start. I found what I thought was a great example on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_Wi_JSmKvI&t=322s"> here</a>. From this video I learned about the loft tool which was essential in creating the curved 3-Dimensional shape of the blades. From what I gathered/have seen, the loft tool is essentially the same as extrude, but does't have to be straight in one direction, and it allows for further control of the end product throught the ability to choose guide raislf or the loft. So after watching that video and a few others to get a some more ideas, I started looking for a porpeler to model off. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="center"> Making the Propeller in Fusion 360: Print Time<h4>
            <p> As I was doing my propeller research, which might actually not have been that useful, I realized that almost nowhere could I find a complete design drawing of a propeller. If I could of found one (and I imagine they are out there), I assume that the porpeller information I was looking at would have been more useful. Instead, I went to using the canvas tool. I found some front and side view profiles of porpellers from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XL8H297/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B07XL8H297&pd_rd_w=Ox0I9&pf_rd_p=cbc856ed-1371-4f23-b89d-d3fb30edf66d&pd_rd_wg=Svn0L&pf_rd_r=58JW2EX4Y8TD8HC78X4D&pd_rd_r=677e9c97-839e-4129-8274-d5ed89944348&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzSjJPTzg4NzdLTkwxJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjE4MTM4VDA0M0RLVVhSSDdLJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3MzA1NzMzNVlERkg5TDYwQzFZJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ=="> this</a> product on amazon. I took those profiles and put them into a new Fusion 360 file. I was unsure on how big to make them, since the 3D print time was constrained to what I thought was 3hrs (but turned out to be 1hr, which in retrospect, makes more sense). To help me gather a better understanding of the scale I could actually build on, I made a 45mm x 45mm box and put it into Prusa Slicer to see how long it would take. Although simple, this helped me get a sense of the duration of the prints.

            <p> Since I now had a better idea on the size of the peice I should be making, I calibrated my canvases using the diameter of the propeller as a guide to make them approximately the size I wanted. It turned out that the front profile wasn't that helpful since I was try to make this fit onto the G20 motor from our lab kits so their middle peice was drastically different than what I wanted. Nevertheless, I started to use the fitpoint spline tool to gauge the general center of where the blade connected to the center. From this I was able to offset the line and create a circle which connected the lines and formed a bounded shape. This was a slightly different method than was used in the tutorial video but it allowed for more accurately representing the curves of the blade. I then created an offset plane (which is a very useful tool I just found out about) to create another sketch some distance away that represented the end of the blade. I repeated this once more to create a middle sketch that I would use to help guide my loft. From there I was able to create another sketch, select "3d Sketch" and create a spline from the ends of each circles which acted as a "rail" for my loft. At this point I was ready to loft and simpliy selected all the faces I wanted the loft to contain. </p>
            <p>After lofting, The blade was done essentially done. But, I realized that the blade didn't really have a curve shape connecting it to the center piece which would result in a weird looking, weaker connection. To strengthen it, I went back and created on more sketch which was in towards the center more and about two times as large as my other sketches. Now when I lofted my profiles, I also selected this sketch which made the blade increase in size where it would be connecting to the center. After this the last thing for me to do was take some measurements of the G20 motor and create a center piece that the motor would fit into. This was pretty simple as I created a similar feature when I modelled the stepper motor. At this point I just used the "circluar array" tool to make more blades, and combined my bodies. </p>

      <p>
        After I finished my design, I exported it to prusa. I rotated it and layed it flat, enabled supports on the buildplate, and I sliced it. I saw that it was going to take 3hrs and was happy since I thought that was the constraint. But, I then saw on slack it was 1hr or less, and as I said before, that made more sense. So I changed to resolution from .05mm to .1mm sliced again and saw that it was under an hour and was able to call it good.

      <p> For exploring photogrammetry, I used the app Qlone. Although you had to buy premuim to get the stl and other file formates, I included some free images and videos of my results. I found that due to how this program is used (by creating a half sphere with your phone camera around the desired object which is on a template) there were some wierd things that can happen. Since I didn't have access to a printer, I used the Ipad that Harvard loaned to me to place my template on. This worked pretty well, but results probably would have been better without the light from the ipad as interference. I also realized due the the half spehre nature, and the fact the camera needs to see all corners of the tempelate, in certain spots it was hard to get low enough which resulted in lots of pointy tops. Although the "flatten top" command worked sometimes it didn't really work for the items with curved tops. Overall, I've very happy with most of my scans (maybe except for the blue & black computer mouse which moved half scan) and I think that I could get some more decent scans.

      <p> I have started to consider what the base of my final project will include and should look like. Ideally, it needs a holds for the laser and motor at the least, and could also include a nice way of storing the metro into a small area. I think to understand more about what it should end up looking like, I need to start playing with the materials to better understand how they will interact. I think a big part of this will be understanding and getting a response from the light sensor.
