      <h3 class="center"> Boat Propeller and Additive Technique:</h3>
      <p>Although I had a few ideas on items that were easier to fabricate using additive methods than subtractive methods, I decided to setting with a boat propeller. The reason why this is easy to fabricate using additive methods is because of the 3D curves and suble overlap of the blades. Expecially with the suble overlap of the blades it would be hard for a subtractive machining technique to get between the blades; this becomes more and more true as you add more blades (such as the the case of a fan). Additionally, due to the curved features of the blades although you could machine one side then turn it and machine the other, it is much easy and leaves less room for errors. To print a propeller, I had to learn a little about them and understand thier dimensions. THe next bit of this webpage me learning about propellers. <b> If you dont care about learning about propellers you can skip to my process of learning fusion propeller building by !!clicking here!! or to skip to the actuall building !!click here!! </b></p>
      <h3 class="center"> Propellers:</h3>
      <p>To learn about propellers the best site I found was from <a href = "https://www.dmsonline.us/propellers-by-the-numbers/"> Datawave Marine Solutions</a>. According to this website there are nine main parts of propellers. Below they are listed with the most important thing I felt from each section;</p>

      <h4 class="center"> Propeller Diameter:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Measured from the cicrle the end of the blades create when spinning </li>
          <li> Bigger = better (as long as its underwater, doesn't hit anything, and usually is even with hull for protection) </li>
        </ul>

      <h4 class="center"> Number of Blades: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Ideally for less vibration/inteference with hull have an odd number of blades. </li>
        </ul>

      <h4 class="center"> Pitch: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Hypopthetical distance a propeller travels in a full spin.</li>
          <li> Pitch important due to strian it can put on motor. </li>
        </ul>

      <h4 class="center"> Blade Area: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Larger Blade Area = Stronger Thrust</li>
          <li> Need to be thick to not snap but thin enough to not create to much drag. </li>
          <li> Three main ways to talk about the area of a blade (due to thier 3D) contortion </li>
            <ol>
              <li> Projected Area &rarr;  </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
