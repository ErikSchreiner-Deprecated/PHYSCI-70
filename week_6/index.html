            <h3 class="center"> Capacitance Sensing: </h3>
            <p> For my capacitance sensor, I created a simple scale. I starting by aligning the two capacitance sensors to try and stancarize the overlap that the have (since from the equation for capacitance, the overlap matters). I then found a buff and tried used that as a "squishy separator." I then layed a ping-pong paddle on top, making my surface flat to place weights on. After uploading the sketch provided that showed us responses in the analog serial, I started to test different weights. I soon realized the analog serial was moving much to fast for me to make much of. To solve this I added "int value = map(sensorValue, 0, 1024, 0, 99)" to my code. This took the sensorValue that was being measured and printed in the serial monitor, and changed it to a smaller range of values. Essentially, I scaled everything down by a factor of 10. This made te numbers not rapidly change as much and I was able to continue to test my sensor. I had 10, 15, 20, 35, and 40lbs weights I was able to set on top of the ping pong paddle to act as a force (the 20lbs weight didn't work out due to it's shape). I placed each weight from light to heavy on top and record the values. The graph can be see on the right (note 0 is with the ping-pong paddle on top). I realized that after I took the wieghts off that teh fabric I was using wasn't really springing back to its original position which could of changed my results (I don't think it had to much affect since I went from light to heavy and not vis versa).  
            </p>
            <p> To test to see if my results were valid I tried the same expirment again, but with a sponge instead of a buff. I checked if the sensorValue of the sponge returned to it's original value after I removed the weights and it did. I found that the graphs looked extremely similar. Oddly enough the sponge shows a greater sensor value, despite being thicker. This would lead me to beleive the permittivity of the sponge I was using is smaller than the permittivity of the buff. This experiment could be improved by; 1) Running more tests. 2) Having more weights. 3) Having a better item then a ping-pong paddle to place the weights on (it would rock a bit). Regardless of the experiment, the general shape I think still holds and it definitely has a logrithmic shape.

            <h3 class="center"> Analog Light Sensor: </h3>
            <p> Keeping in mind how I am hoping my final project will owkr, I tried experimenting with an anolog light sensor that I had. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1384">Here</a> is the link to the adafruit page for the sensor. It was pretty simple to hook up to the serial monitor. There was only a power, ground, and sensor pins to connect to. When I got it reading, I repeated the same thing as I did above in regards to scaling the serial output down. I tried to standarize my experiment here as well by recording the values while using my phone's (Samsung s10+) flashlight (on high),  slowly incrementing the distance away from the sensor. The graph is shown on the left. There are a few things to note; 1) The 0 point is ambient light. 2) The x-axis is in cm. 3) The x=1 point is propabaly wrong due to the impedence of wires on the placement on my phone. 4) The x=100 point was not measured to be 100cm away, only estimated. Once again, regardless of the general shape of the function can be seen. I additionally palce a blanket over the sensor and successfully got the value "1." I also used a high power laser I had and succesfully got numbers in the high 90's. I also moved my hand up and down oveer the sensor to see the change with shade, but this was much harder to standardize. But, it did appear to have an exponetial trend as well. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="center"> Ultra Sonic Range Finder: </h3>
            <p> I also had an ultra sonic rangefinder which I placed around with as well. There are more pins to control it than the light sensor, but I think I did hook it up to the serial monitor successfully. I haven't read enough about it or experimented enough with it to get a great idea of what is happening, but it definitely has a simpliar exponential behavior with a fast drop off. One thing that I have to look into is that angle of sensing (which I guess you can change), since it appears to be sensing at almost 180 degrees currently.

    <p> In regards to the final project, the sensors I was experimenting with are to help me get a sense of what is possible within my project. I hope to get a bit better nderstanding of where the sensors would have to be to work effectely, then I can create a box for my components
