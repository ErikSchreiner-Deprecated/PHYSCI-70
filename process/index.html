            <h3 class="center"> Final Project Progress </h3>
            <p> During class and lab this week after setting up one of the motor shafts (since I didn't have the bearing for the other), I started to mess around with the limits of the accelstepper library. I took me a little while to figure out the units of the library and what each class tells the stepper to do. I still don't understand everything, like why the stepper would turn left and right when the commands were all in the positive direction (this might be because of the 1000 step max). Anyways, I need the stepper to spin fast for my final project so I was playing with 6 digit accelerations and speeds and seeing what the motor could handle before skipping steps.
