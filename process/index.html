            <p> Since I have already played with the light sensors and the stepper motor, the main part of the prject that I haven't explored is the arduino to MIDI functionallity. I looked at that a bit more this week. I have seen and remembered JuHye also mentioning this Hairless to MIDI input. I downloaded and played a little with that but haven't made much progress with actual transfer of data. I believe the data type I was sending was wrong.

            <p> I focused mainly on getting the hairless Midi to work. After downloading <a href = "https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth">this</a> virtual synth and reading a about midi data types and the arduino library "Arduino MIDI Library," I spent some time trying to get the huzzah to actually sent data through the serial monitor. I first had to download a "soundfont" which had a bunch of instuments programmed into it that the virtual synth will choose from depending on the number I sent through the serial. I stuggled for a while because I have two monitors and I had the output set to my monitor speaker which was turned all the way down. After figured out that problem, I was able to get it to work and I figured out by looking into the MIDI library to change the note I can use the line of code "MIDI.sendPitchBend(frequency, channel);" So, after figuring this out I essentially have all parts of my final project and I had to put everything together and create a case for it.

            <h3 class="center"> Week 13: </h3>
            <p> The past week I've been mainly working on the coding for the laser harp. I am just trying to put everyhting together at this point. I managed to code a automatic sensor calibrator which will record the light on start up or on reset. Then I've been working mainly on getting the notes to have a small delay, because currently when they play it plays multiple notes in a second since the code is excuting the noteOn line as fast as the code is running. I also have thought of the way to distinguish between each notes. I realized I can use the mod function to get what beam is active since each beam is controlled through a millis() timer. For example, suppose I make 3 beams (so one laser flashes 3 times before returning to the origional beam, making it appear like 3 separate beams). Lets say the beams are on for 1000 ms and off for a negligible amount of time. Then millis() mod 3000 will give me a number in the set [0,3). The numbers in the set [0, 1) would correspond with the time of the first beam, [1, 2) for the second beam, and [2,3) for the third beam. Therefore if the millis() mod 3000 has a reading of 1.6 when the light sensor goes over the threshold set by the automatic calibrator, it means beam 2 was broken and I can make that play a note associated with that beam. And, although not done, I've included what I have now which plays a note when the light sensor goes over the threshold set by the calibrate function. And below is my bill of materials:

            <p> My final project has been taking a little longer than hoped. I thought it would be pretty simple to integrate all the part together bit I found that I am very bad at stepper motor control. After reaching out and recieving some starter code from Nathan I had something that would rotate one way to many how many beams was desired. But, I wasn't it to rtate back and forth to help reach persistance of vision. After editing the code in a way I thought would help spin the motor both directions, I was stumped when after behaving for a short amount of time the motor just spun in circles. I just thought I was doing something wrong but after reaching out to Nathan again it seemed as if my code was okay.I hopped into office hours to see if we could get to the bottom of this and we found that in order to spin backwards, the function "setSpeed" must be negative. In hindsight, this still isn't clear to why this should be this way. Speed should only be speed and not direction. It would be more clear if the function was called setVelocity, since velocity consists of both speed and direction. Regardless, it works now and I found that if I turn the time the laser is on to 5 milliseconds, the beam still shows up and the speed I set does not matter. In the code below the speed is set to 25000 and it works reliably, but as soon as I change the delay to 10 milliseconds the motor skips a lot of steps. The delay must essentially be so negligable it is almost like the motor doesn't stop.
