            <p> Since I have already played with the light sensors and the stepper motor, the main part of the prject that I haven't explored is the arduino to MIDI functionallity. I looked at that a bit more this week. I have seen and remembered JuHye also mentioning this Hairless to MIDI input. I downloaded and played a little with that but haven't made much progress with actual transfer of data. I believe the data type I was sending was wrong.
