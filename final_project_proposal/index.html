		<h3 class="center"> The Project: A Laser Harp </h3>
		<p> For my final project I am interested in making a laser harp. It is a musical intrument that uses a laser that, once broken, signals to a light sensor to play a coresponding note. From what I expect, it would use knowledge from many weeks such as input, output, programming, and hand tools, to name a few. </p>
		<p> There are two different types of laser harps. The first is a framed laser harp, and this consists of multiple lasers and takes the form of a typical harp. The second is a frameless laser harp. This consists of one laser (usually) that is projected back and forth in a sprinkler-like pattern. </p>

			<h3 class="center"> How it works </h3>
			<p> In the 2d sketch of a laser harp, 1 is the laser. And then 2 is a mirror that is connected to a motor that jumps back in forth to create different beams of the harp (note: this is a rough sketch and might require a different mirror configuration to actually work). At high speeds, the laser beams are projected back and forth fast enough, and it appears as if they are solid.</p>
			<p> In the 3d sketch, you can see parts 1 and 2 still, but now you have a light sensor that picks up on the reflection of the beam when it is broken by your hand (3). And you additionally have all the wiring and circuit boards that connect the motor to the light sensor in order to sychronize what sound is to be played (4). </p>
