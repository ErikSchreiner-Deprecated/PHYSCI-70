            <h3 class="center"> Remote Server: </h3>
            <p> This week I was able to successfully set up the firebase server. Although I was more interested in the other parts of this meek (mainly API's) I was able to work through the tutorials for firebase and get those to work. Below is just some gifs demostrating that.

            <p> Similiarly to firebase, I didn't spend that long on the bluetooth. But, once again, I was able to set up the basic code.

            <h3 class="center"> API and Webscraping: </h3>
            <p> Like bluetooth and the remote server, I was able to set up the example code. I was much more interested in the prospect of webscraping and being able to pull whatever you want. When I was browsing one of the links explaining all the different API's that are out there, I was grabbed by gmail's api. I was interested in setting up an automatic email that I could send to a few of my friend that automatically changed what was in the body of the email. I was thinking at first I could use another API (like <a href="https://shibe.online/">this dog one</a>) to be the body of the email. Although, gmail's <a hraf="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/sending">website</a> was a little confusing to me for setting up an API. They had different options for what you were coding in, but I was not sure what exactly would work in arduino since I didn't see C++. So, instead of working through something that might not work I started googling other options.

            <p> I made a mistake at first googling other options for "arduino." Although I'm sure the options I found could of worked, after downloading a library from github which was lacking in a full explaination to use (if not using gmail), I re-googled sending an email with a <b>ESP32</b>. I instantly saw a <a hraf="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-send-email-smtp-server-arduino-ide/#:~:text=SMTP%20means%20Simple%20Mail%20Transfer%20Protocol%20and%20it,or%20without%20attachment%20via%20SMTP%20and%20IMAP%20servers.">Random Nerd Tutorial</a> and figured it would be very useful. It was. The first thing it suggests is to create a new email because your email can be blocked if you accidently send to much. This was good to know. So after creating a new email, I was able to just follow along with that tutorial which was very intuitive and was able to send an email to myself.

            <p> Now that I could send emails and had dog pictures, I just had to get them to work together. This, I sadly could not do. I could not get the link that was given to me from the dog API into the subject of the email. I tried to instead find a way to download the link through the serial monitor and then attach it to the email as a .txt file. After a good amount of googling and more time playing with puTTY, I was able get the puTTy so save what was in the serial monitor. But, more was printing into the serial monitor than I wanted and I had to run puTTy myself to get it to save the monitor, which defeated the point of automating this. So I was not able to get an automatic email that would send dog pictures :(
